# Ship Simulator
It is a very very old project, which I did as a final task for programming courses. It is very messy, glitchy and janky, contains a lot of useless stuff and loud sounds. I still decided to share it, because why not. 

I didn't do any changes to this code besides making it work in MS VS 2022 and I probably won't, since it doesn't make any sense and it was just made for fun. Which means that it contains untranslated text, which I will describe later.

It's made in MS Visual Studio using .NET Framework and Windows Forms builder, so you need at least .NET Framework 4.3 to build and run it.

# How to play
!!! WARNING !!!
It contains loud sounds since I didn't know how to decrease them at the time, so I recommend as soon as you run a programm to decrease the volume using Windows mixer.

As it contains a lot of russian text, I'll translate some important stuff.

As soon as you start up the programm you'll see a message, which reads the following:
"Hello, welcome to the almost realistic simulator of controlling the space aircraft. Your task is to deliever goods and passengers to designated destinations. Good luck!"
This describes the main gameplay there.

On the screen you'll see 3 planets: Earth, Moon and Mars. You'll also see you spaceship in the center of the map.
In order to start up your ship, you'll need to press the button on the bottom-left corner of the window. After you press it you'll be able to control your ship using buttons in the bottom-middle of the window. You need to press it every time you want to make a move.

Also you'll notice a progress bar after you started up. It indicated the pressure of your aircraft. It will decrease each time you make a move and after it reaches 50% bar, the compressor will turn on and you won't be able to control your spaceship until the pressure will reach a certain amount, at which compressor will disable and you'll be able to proceed further.

When you'll fly into one of the planets, you need to press on one and you will receive messages, which contain type of goods or passengers and a destination. After heading into the destination you will need to press on designated planet and a task will be finished.
